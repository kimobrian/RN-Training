# RNRealworldAnimations

A sample React Native app showing how to implement different kinds of animations.

This is the starter project which doesn't have any of the animations yet. 
Switch to the master branch or any other branch based on the tutorial 
that you're currently following.

Full tutorial is available at: [http://blog.pusher.com/animation-react-native-part-1/](http://blog.pusher.com/animation-react-native-part-1/)

_Note: the React Native code in this repo may be a little bit outdated and won't run immediately after you've followed the setup instructions. Be sure to refactor the code to use the more recent React Native syntax if it doesn't run for you._
